#
#==Description
#GCal4Ruby has three major components: the service, calendar and event objects.  Each service
#has many calendars, which in turn have many events.  Each service is the representation of a
#google account, and thus must be successfully authenticated using valid Google Calendar
#account credentials.  
#
#==Examples
#Below are some common usage examples.  For more examples, check the documentation.
#===Service
#1. Authenticate
#    service = Service.new
#    service.authenticate("user@gmail.com", "password")
#
#2. Get Calendar List
#    calendars = service.calendars
#
#===Calendar
#All usages assume a successfully authenticated Service.
#1. Create a new Calendar
#    cal = Calendar.new(service)
#
#2. Find a calendar by ID
#    cal = Calendar.find(service, {:id => cal_id})
#
#3. Get all calendar events
#    cal = Calendar.find(service, {:id => cal_id})
#    events = cal.events
#
#4. Find an existing calendar by title
#    cal = Calendar.find(service, {:title => "New Calendar"})
#
#5. Find all calendars containing a search term
#    cal = Calendar.find(service, "Soccer Team")
#===Event
#All usages assume a successfully authenticated Service and valid Calendar.
#1. Create a new Event
#    event = Event.new(service, {:calendar => cal, :title => "Soccer Game", :start => Time.parse("12-06-2009 at 12:30 PM"), :end => Time.parse("12-06-2009 at 1:30 PM"), :where => "Merry Playfields"})
#    event.save
#
#2. Find an existing Event by title
#    event = Event.find(service, {:title => "Soccer Game"})
#
#3. Find an existing Event by ID
#    event = Event.find(service, {:id => event.id})
#
#4. Find all events containing the search term
#    event = Event.find(service, "Soccer Game")
#
#5. Find all events on a calendar containing the search term
#    event = Event.find(service, "Soccer Game", {:calendar => cal.id})
#
#6. Find events within a date range
#    event = Event.find(service, "Soccer Game", {'start-min' => Time.parse("01/01/2010").utc.xmlschema, 'start-max' => Time.parse("06/01/2010").utc.xmlschema})
#
#7. Create a recurring event for every saturday
#    event = Event.new(service)
#    event.title = "Baseball Game"
#    event.calendar = cal
#    event.where = "Municipal Stadium"
#    event.recurrence = Recurrence.new
#    event.recurrence.start_time = Time.parse("06/20/2009 at 4:30 PM")
#    event.recurrence.end_time = Time.parse("06/20/2009 at 6:30 PM")
#    event.recurrence.frequency = {"weekly" => ["SA"]}
#    event.save 
#
#8. Create an event with a 15 minute email reminder
#    event = Event.new(service)
#    event.calendar = cal
#    event.title = "Dinner with Kate"
#    event.start_time = Time.parse("06/20/2009 at 5 pm")
#    event.end_time = Time.parse("06/20/2009 at 8 pm")
#    event.where = "Luigi's"
#    event.reminder = {:minutes => 15, :method => 'email'}
#    event.save
#
#9. Create an event with attendees
#    event = Event.new(service)
#    event.calendar = cal
#    event.title = "Dinner with Kate"
#    event.start_time = Time.parse("06/20/2009 at 5 pm")
#    event.end_time = Time.parse("06/20/2009 at 8 pm")
#    event.attendees => {:name => "Kate", :email => "kate@gmail.com"}
#    event.save
