#
#==Introduction
#GData4Ruby is a full featured wrapper for the Google Data base API.  GData4Ruby provides the ability
#to authenticate with GData using the ClientLogin method.  The package also includes a base gdata object 
#that can be subclassed to provide basic CRUD functions for all Google API service objects.  Additionally,
#a basic ACL object is included for interacting with ACL feeds and setting access rules.

#
#==Description
#GData4Ruby has three major components: the service, the GData object and the AccessRule object.  Each service
#represents a google account, and includes a username (email) and a password.  You can use the GData service
#to authenticate either a google account or a google apps account.
#
#The GData object provides a base class for interacting with Google API objects, i.e. Documents, Events, etc.  The 
#GData object contains common attributes present in all Google API objects, and provides interfaces for basic CRUD
#functions.  This class is meant to be subclassed.
#
#The AccessRule object provides a base class for interacting with Google Access Control Lists.  ACLs provide the 
#main permissions mechanism for most Google API services.
#
#==Examples
#Below are some common usage examples.  For more examples, check the documentation.
#===Service
#1. Authenticate
#    service = Service.new
#    service.authenticate("user@gmail.com", "password", "cl")
#
#2. Authenticate with a specified GData version
#	service = Service.new({:gdata_version => '3.0'})
#	service.authenticate("user@gmail.com", "password", "cl")
